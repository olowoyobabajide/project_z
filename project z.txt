Great! Since you’re an intermediate in C and likely balancing other things too, here’s a realistic **12-week timeline** broken into **weekly goals and tasks**. This assumes a part-time schedule (5–10 hrs/week). If you want to go faster or slower, we can adjust.

---

### **WEEKLY PROJECT PLAN (C-based Threat Scanner)**

#### **Week 1 – Project Setup & Scope Finalization**

* Define exactly what you want to detect (e.g., suspicious functions, file permissions).
* Choose your target file types (e.g., ELF on Linux).
* Set up your development environment: `gcc`, `make`, `valgrind`, `readelf`, etc.
* Create a Git repo & folder structure.

#### **Week 2 – Learn File Format Internals**

* Deep dive into your target file format (e.g., ELF or PE).
* Practice parsing headers using `readelf` and `objdump`.
* Sketch out how your scanner will inspect these files.

#### **Week 3 – File Scanning Engine (Basic)**

* Write C code to scan directories and identify files.
* Implement file extension filtering and recursion.
* Add logging (console + file).

#### **Week 4 – Analyze File Headers**

* Implement parsing of file headers (start with ELF if on Linux).
* Extract info like entry point, section headers, and flags.
* Print findings to console.

#### **Week 5 – Static Detection Rules (Unsafe Functions)**

* Write static code scanning functions to detect use of functions like `strcpy`, `gets`, `system`.
* If scanning binaries: scan for strings using `strings` or custom binary analysis.

#### **Week 6 – Add Signature Checking (Simple)**

* Create a simple hash database (SHA256 or MD5 of known bad files).
* Implement hashing with `openssl` or custom logic.
* Compare scanned files to your local "threat DB".

#### **Week 7 – Scan File Metadata / Permissions**

* Use `stat()` and `access()` to detect risky file permissions (e.g., SUID, world-writable).
* Detect hidden or suspicious file names.

#### **Week 8 – Reporting Engine**

* Design a CLI report format (color-coded risk levels).
* Add logging options: text file, JSON format (optional).
* Include summary: scanned files, threats found, issues flagged.

#### **Week 9 – Modularization & CLI Options**

* Refactor code into modules: scanner, analysis, reporter, etc.
* Add command-line options: `-d` for directory, `-f` for file, `-r` for recursive, etc.

#### **Week 10 – Testing & Validation**

* Test on sample files (create test cases with insecure code or patterns).
* Use the EICAR test file or similar safe examples.
* Tune detection logic to reduce false positives.

#### **Week 11 – Optimization & Polish**

* Improve performance (e.g., scan speed, memory usage).
* Add better error handling.
* Clean up console output & formatting.

#### **Week 12 – Documentation & Wrap-up**

* Write a README with usage examples.
* Comment your code for clarity.
* Package as a CLI tool with a `Makefile`.
* (Optional) Add a short demo or documentation video.
